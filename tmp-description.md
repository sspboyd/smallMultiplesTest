Looking at the limits of small multiples. Some work in progress shots. 
I love seeing same code base can create completely different visual impressions by tweaking the underlying variables. As always, the most interesting images are created by accident. 
Here's the underlying code for these images. 


Limits of small multiples.
Quick (and dirty) experiments generative graphs (aren't they all generative though?). I'm looking at the limits of small multiples. At what point do the individual charts lose their individual meaning and blend back into a single collective image/pattern?
I also like the retro colour / feel of these.
